Plants must be equipped with thermal accumulation systems. On top of the selling price, net electricity produced by thermodynamic solar plants commissioned after 18 July 2008 can obtain a feed-in premium for 25 years. Up to 2012 the bonus varies from EUR 0.22 to EUR 0.28 / kWh depending on the level of integration of the plants. In case of hybrid plants, the feed-in tariff decreases depending on the ratio between the amount of energy not produced by a solar energy source and the amount produced by a solar energy source. The maximum cumulative power of all solar thermodynamic plants eligible for the incentives corresponds to 1.5 million m2 of cumulative surface. The national objective of total power to be installed by 2016 corresponds to 2 million m2 of cumulative surface. For the 2013-2014 period such bonus values will be reduced by 2% a year; from 2014 onward special Ministerial Decree will define further cuts.

- Growing the share of private sector in the GDP (at constant prices of 2010) from 44.9% in 2014, to 50.6% in 2019.
- Increasing the annual growth rate of the manufacturing industries sector from 8.36%in 2014 to 10.58% in 2019, and the Mining and Quarrying sector from 5.98% in 2014 to 8.56% in 2019.
- Increase in public investment is planned for the coming five years, about 2.4 trillion Riyal to finance development projects of the major sectors, including human resources, economic resources, social and health, and infrastructure. The 10th development Plan allocates 372 billion Riyals for spending on infrastructure, which is about 76% more than what was allocated in the 9th Plan.

""As a first step towards greater diversification, the plan envisages raising utilisation rates of mineral resources, diversifying sector activities and developing local processing of mining raw materials. In terms of petrochemicals, this will involve developing upstream and downstream industrial activities that depend on oil and gas. Production capacity in the industrial sector will also be expanded in line with the National Industrial Strategy, with an emphasis on projects related to the diversification of energy sources away from oil.

""Based on the policies stipulated in the Strategic Energy Plan, which the Cabinet approved in April 2014, METI established the Long-term Energy Supply and Demand Subcommittee under the Strategic Policy Committee of the Advisory Committee for Natural Resources and Energy in order to consider a future vision of a realistic, yet well-balanced energy supply and demand structure. So far, a total of 11 meetings on these matters have been held.
""METI has approved the Long-term Energy Supply and Demand Outlook based on the report compiled by the subcommittee.""
The energy and demand outlook for 2030 serves as de facto energy efficiency and renewable energy targets. For renewable energy, it is described that Japan will aim to increase the share of renewables in total electricity generation to 22-24% by 2030. For energy efficiency, it is described that Japan will aim to reduce its final energy use by about 10%, from 361 million kl crude oil equivalent (coe) in 2010 to 326 million kl coe in 2030.
Original title: ????????????. For the primary energy supply, the envision structure for FY2030 is as follows: renewables 13-14%,Nuclear power: 10-11%, Natural gas: 18%, Coal: 25%, LPG: 3%, Oil 30%. For the power source mix, the structure is for FY2030 is as follows: Renewables: 22-24%, Nuclear power 20-22%, LNG: 27%, Coal: 26%, Oil 3%. Renewables are divided into: Geothermal: 1-1.1%; Biomass: 3.7-4.6%, Wind: 1.7%; Solar: 7%; Hydro: 8.8-9.2%. With a projection of economic growth at 1.7%/year, energy efficiency and conservation measures are also expected to allow a 196.1 bn kWh reduction (reduction of 17%).
Japan's INDC is developed based on this Long-Term Energy Supply and Demand Outlook.
