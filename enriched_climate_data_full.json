The 10th development Plan allocates 372 billion Riyals for spending on infrastructure, which is about 76% more than what was allocated in the 9th Plan. This will be accompanied by new measures for the rationalization of government spending.\" (http://g20.org.tr/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/g20_comprehensive_growth_strategy_saudi_arabia.pdf)\n\"As a first step towards greater diversification, the plan envisages raising utilisation rates of mineral resources, diversifying sector activities and developing local processing of mining raw materials. In terms of petrochemicals, this will involve developing upstream and downstream industrial activities that depend on oil and gas. Production capacity in the industrial sector will also be expanded in line with the National Industrial Strategy, with an emphasis on projects related to the diversification of energy sources away from oil. The plan aims to increase the contribution of the services sector to GDP, with an emphasis on financial, tourism, transport, engineering, communications and IT services, according to the Ministry of Economy and Planning (MEP).\" (http://www.oxfordbusinessgroup.com/analysis/long-game-new-development-plan-shows-clear-commitment-education-and-private-sector)",

As an action towards achieving air quality improvements, China aims to remove 4 million high-emissions vehicles that are currently on the roads. Subsidies and tax breaks to support new technologies are already in place and will continue to be.\nAims to lift 70 million people out of poverty by 2020 (all population currently below the poverty line of annual income 2300 yuan per year) (http://www.apcoworldwide.com/docs/default-source/default-document-library/Thought-Leadership/13-five-year-plan-think-piece.pdf?sfvrsn=2)\n\"Reduction of water consumption by 35% by 2020 as compared with 2013 (which is consistent with the target in the Water Pollution Prevention and Control Action Plan)\" (http://www.kwm.com/en/au/knowledge/insights/china-13th-5-year-plan-environment-sustainability-initiatives-20160414)\nAims to have 15% energy intensity reduction in 2020 compared to 2015.\nAccording to WRI (2016) the included carbon intensity target will decrease by almost 50% by 2020 compared to 2005.\nRatified by National People's Congress in March 2016 (https://www.uscc.gov/sites/default/files/Research/The%2013th%20Five-Year%20Plan.pdf) IEA/IRENA Global Renewable Energy Policies and Measures Database © OECD/IEA and IRENA, [November 2020]",

So far, a total of 11 meetings on these matters have been held.\n\"METI has approved the Long-term Energy Supply and Demand Outlook based on the report compiled by the subcommittee.\"\nThe energy and demand outlook for 2030 serves as de facto energy efficiency and renewable energy targets. For renewable energy, it is described that Japan will aim to increase the share of renewables in total electricity generation to 22-24% by 2030. For energy efficiency, it is described that Japan will aim to reduce its final energy use by about 10%, from 361 million kl crude oil equivalent (coe) in 2010 to 326 million kl coe in 2030.\nOriginal title: ????????????. For the primary energy supply, the envision structure for FY2030 is as follows: renewables 13-14%,Nuclear power: 10-11%, Natural gas: 18%, Coal: 25%, LPG: 3%, Oil 30%. For the power source mix, the structure is for FY2030 is as follows: Renewables: 22-24%, Nuclear power 20-22%, LNG: 27%, Coal: 26%, Oil 3%. Renewables are divided into: Geothermal: 1-1.1%; Biomass: 3.7-4.6%, Wind: 1.7%; Solar: 7%; Hydro: 8.8-9.2%. With a projection of economic growth at 1.7%/year, energy efficiency and conservation measures are also expected to allow a 196.1 bn kWh reduction (reduction of 17%).\nJapan's INDC is developed based on this Long-Term Energy Supply and Demand Outlook.\n(Source: http://www.meti.go.jp/english/press/2015/0716_01.html)",
